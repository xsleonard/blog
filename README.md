## Adding new content sections

*Assumes theme https://github.com/xsleonard/pristine*

Create a new folder in `content/`. To control the name explicitly, add an `_index.md` file inside
of that folder with `title` in the frontmatter.

The sections will appear automatically on the home page, which lists all posts.
